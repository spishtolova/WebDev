            <b> Work Fast with Ice Cream </b>:  Keep the ice cream extra frozen before assembly to prevent melting while spreading the meringue.
        <li>
           <b>Use a Kitchen Torch for Precision </b>: While the oven works, a torch gives better control and avoids melting the ice cream.

           <b>Make Ahead for Convenience </b>: You can freeze the assembled Baked Alaska (without toasting the meringue) for up to 2 days before serving!

    <h2>Baked Alaska: A Show-Stopping Frozen Delight</h2>
    <p> Baked Alaska is the ultimate dessert for those who love both fire and ice! This spectacular treat features a layer of cake, a dome of ice cream, and a fluffy meringue topping, all toasted to golden perfection.</p>  
    <p> A dessert that’s as dramatic as it is delicious! Baked Alaska is the perfect balance of hot and cold—fluffy, golden-browned meringue hiding layers of creamy ice cream and soft cake. The magic happens when it’s torched or baked, creating a caramelized shell that crackles with every bite.</p>
    <p> The contrast between the cold ice cream and the warm, caramelized meringue makes every bite a magical experience. Whether you’re hosting a dinner party or just want to impress, this Baked Alaska is sure to steal the show!</p>
    <h2>Instructions </h2>
    <p>Preheat oven to 175°C (350°F). Grease and line a 9-inch round cake pan. In a bowl, whisk flour, baking powder, and salt.</p>
     <p>In another bowl, beat butter and sugar until fluffy. Add eggs one at a time, then mix in vanilla.
        Alternate adding dry ingredients and milk, mixing until just combined.Pour batter into the pan and bake for 20–25 minutes. Let cool completely.
    
        
     <h2> Shape The Cake: </h2> 
     <p>Line a medium-sized bowl with plastic wrap. Soften the ice cream slightly and scoop it into the bowl, pressing it in firmly. Smooth the top, cover, and freeze for at least 4 hours or overnight.</p>
     <p>Place the cooled cake on a serving plate. Unmold the frozen ice cream dome and place it on top of the cake. </p>
       <h2> Make the Meringue:</h2>
       <p>Beat egg whites and cream of tartar until soft peaks form. Gradually add sugar and continue beating until stiff, glossy peaks form. Mix in vanilla.</p>
       <p>Spread the meringue over the ice cream and cake, sealing it completely. Use a kitchen torch to lightly brown the meringue OR bake in a 220°C (425°F) oven for 3–5 minutes until golden. </p>
     <p> Slice and serve right away, or freeze for later—just let it sit at room temperature for 5–10 minutes before slicing.</p>
     <h2> Final Thoughts</h2>
       <p>Baked Alaska is the perfect dessert for making a statement! The warm, toasty meringue and the cold, creamy ice cream create a contrast that’s both delicious and visually stunning. Whether it’s a birthday, holiday, or just a fancy treat, this dessert is sure to impress.</p>
