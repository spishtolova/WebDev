     <h2>Instructions </h2>
     <p>
        Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and line two 9-inch (23 cm) round cake pans with parchment paper.</p>
       <p> In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger. Set aside. In a large mixing bowl, beat together the granulated sugar, brown sugar, and oil until well combined. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract. </p>
       <p> Gradually fold in the dry ingredients until just combined. Be careful not to overmix. Gently fold in the grated carrots, and if using, the nuts and raisins. </p>
       <p>Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans and smooth the tops. Bake for 25–30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
        Let the cakes cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely. </p>
        
     <h2> Make the Frosting: </h2> 
     <p>In a large bowl, beat the cream cheese and butter together until smooth and creamy.
     Gradually add the powdered sugar, one cup at a time, beating until fully incorporated. Stir in the vanilla extract and salt. /p>
    <h2>Assemble the Cake:</h2> 
     <p>Place one cake layer on a serving plate and spread a generous layer of frosting on top.
     Place the second cake layer on top and frost the top and sides of the cake.
     Decorate with additional chopped nuts or grated carrots, if desired.</p>

     <p>Serve this beauty at your next family gathering or enjoy it with a hot cup of tea on a quiet afternoon. It’s a slice of comfort you’ll come back to time and again!</p>
