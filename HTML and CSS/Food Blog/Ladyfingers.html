            <b> Don’t Overmix the Batter </b>:  Gently fold the egg whites into the yolks to keep the batter light and airy.
        <li>
           <b> Double-Dusting for Extra Crunch  </b>: Sprinkle powdered sugar twice before baking to create a crispier top layer, perfect for soaking up coffee or syrup.

        <li>
           <b>Let Them Dry for Better Absorption </b>: If using for Tiramisu or trifles, let the Ladyfingers sit uncovered for a few hours before layering—they’ll soak up liquid without getting mushy!

    <h2>Homemade Ladyfingers: The Perfect Light & Airy Treat</h2>
    <p> Delicate, airy, and lightly sweet, Ladyfingers (Savoiardi) are the essential building blocks for classic desserts like Tiramisu, Charlotte cakes, and trifles.</p>  
    <p> But they’re just as delicious on their own with a cup of coffee or tea! These homemade Ladyfingers have a crisp exterior with a soft, spongy inside, making them far better than store-bought. </p>
    <p> Get ready for a treat that’s light, fluffy, and absolutely delicious! These homemade ladyfingers are perfect for any dessert—whether it's tiramisu or just enjoyed on their own. Made with simple ingredients like eggs, sugar, flour, and vanilla, these golden, sweet cookies will melt in your mouth.</p>
    <h2>Instructions </h2>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 180°C (350°F). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Fit a piping bag with a large round tip (or use a ziplock bag with the corner cut off).</p>
     <p>In a bowl, whisk the egg yolks with 50g of sugar until thick and pale. Stir in the vanilla extract.
        In a separate clean bowl, beat the egg whites with a pinch of salt until soft peaks form. Gradually add the remaining 50g of sugar and beat until stiff peaks form. </p>

     <p>Sift together the flour and baking powder, then gently fold it into the egg yolk mixture.Carefully fold in the whipped egg whites in two additions, making sure not to deflate the batter. </p>
       <p>Transfer to a piping bag and pipe 3-4 inch strips onto the prepared baking sheet, leaving space between them. Dust the tops with powdered sugar to give them their signature crispiness.</p>
       <p>Bake for 10–12 minutes, or until lightly golden and firm to the touch. Let cool completely before using or storing. </p>
     <p> Ladyfingers can be stored in an airtight container for up to a week, or frozen for later use!</p>
     <h2> Final Thoughts</h2>
       <p>Once you try homemade Ladyfingers, you’ll never go back to store-bought! These delicate biscuits are softer and fresher with the perfect crispness on the outside. Whether you’re layering them into a creamy Tiramisu or just dunking them into coffee, these light and airy treats are a must-have in your baking repertoire.</p>
