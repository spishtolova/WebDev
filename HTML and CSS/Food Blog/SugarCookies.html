    <h2>A Sweet Tradition: The Perfect Sugar Cookies</h2>
    <p> There’s something nostalgic about baking sugar cookies. The moment the dough comes together—soft, buttery, and full of vanilla aroma—it brings back childhood memories of sneaking a taste before rolling it out. Sugar cookies always have a way of making any moment feel special.</p>  
    <p> Whether you’re baking them for a holiday celebration, a cozy weekend treat, or simply to brighten someone’s day, sugar cookies are a classic favorite that never goes out of style.</p>
    <p>These cookies are as versatile as they are delicious. From a simple sprinkle of sugar to intricate icing designs, sugar cookies offer endless opportunities for creativity. </p>
    <p>With this simple yet foolproof recipe, you’ll have a batch of perfectly golden sugar cookies ready to share (or keep all to yourself!). They’re not just cookies; they’re memories waiting to be made.</p>
     <h2>Instructions </h2>
     <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.</p>
       <p> In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and baking powder. Set aside. In a large bowl, use a hand or stand mixer to cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy (about 2-3 minutes).</p>
       <p> Mix in the egg, vanilla extract, and almond extract (if using) until fully incorporated. </p>
       <p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing on low speed. If the dough feels too crumbly, add 1 tablespoon of milk at a time until it comes together. </p>
       <p> Scoop tablespoon-sized portions of dough and roll them into balls. If desired, roll the balls in colored sugar or sprinkles for decoration. Place them 2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets.</p>
       <p>Bake in the preheated oven for 8-10 minutes, or until the edges are set and lightly golden. Be careful not to overbake—sugar cookies should stay soft.</p>
       <p> Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 2 minutes, then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.</p>        
       <p> Once cooled, decorate with royal icing or buttercream frosting if desired. Let the frosting set before stacking or storing.</p>

     <p>Enjoy your sweet and buttery sugar cookies at any time of the day!</p>
