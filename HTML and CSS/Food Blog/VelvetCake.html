            <b>Use Buttermilk for a Soft, Moist Crumb</b>: Buttermilk is key to achieving that tender texture.
        </li>
        <li>
           <b>Don’t Overmix the Batter </b>: Overmixing can make the cake dense. Stir until the ingredients are just combined to keep it light and fluffy.
        </li>
        <li>
           <b>Chill the Cake Before Frosting </b>: For cleaner, smoother frosting, let the cake layers cool completely, then chill them in the fridge for 30 minutes before assembling.
