    <h1 id="maintext"> About Me 🍰✨</h1>
    <p id="sidetext"> Greetings! I'm Stella, a passionate home baker with a love for all things sweet and homemade. </p>
    <br>
    <h3 id="sideheader"> How did I get into baking? </h3>
    <p id="sidetext">My journey into baking started in my grandmother’s kitchen, where the scent of freshly baked bread and cookies filled the air.</p>
    <p id="sidetext">I remember standing on a little wooden stool, watching in awe, teaching me that baking isn’t just about following a recipe.</p>
    <p id="sidetext"> It’s about love, patience, and a little bit of magic.</p>
    <br>

    <h3 id="sideheader"> Something more about me! </h3>
    <p id="sidetext">As I grew older, my fascination with flavors and textures deepened. I found myself experimenting with everything
    <p id="sidetext"> From classic chocolate chip cookies, cakes to all sorts of delicate French pastries.</p>
    <p id="sidetext">There’s something so special about transforming simple ingredients into something that brings joy to others. </p>
    <p id="sidetext"> Whether it’s the warm comfort of a homemade loaf of banana bread or the elegance of a perfectly piped macaron, each creation tells a story.</p>
    <br>

    <h3 id="sideheader"> Why a blog? </h3>
    <p id="sidetext">This blog is my little corner of the internet, where I share my favorite recipes, baking tips, and the inspiration behind each sweet treat. </p>
    <p id="sidetext">Whether you're a seasoned baker or just starting out, I hope my recipes spark creativity in your kitchen and bring a little extra sweetness to your day! 🍪🎂💕 </p>
